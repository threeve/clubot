# clubot

A bot, to do things.

## Overview

Clubot is like hubot, but different.

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel dev

then run `node out/clubot.js`.
This will auto compile and send all changes to node without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a REPL.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein cljsbuild once min
